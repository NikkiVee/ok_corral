## Abstract

Howdy.

OKCorral is, at its core, a clone of OKCupid built on Rails using React/Redux. However, it includes several interesting design tweaks.

CSS hover interactions make the interface feel bouncier. Mouse movement is more deliberate and meaningful—OKCorral responds to your touch. I made these changes hoping that a more playful, responsive mode of interaction would lead to a kinder, more easygoing attitude toward online dating.

All of the hallmark features of OKCupid are here—users can answer matching questions, filter matches based on distance and age, and view and message matches that interest them. It will be interesting to see how the perception of these features changes with my updated design language. Hopefully, OKCorral is light, fun, and satisfying to play with.
